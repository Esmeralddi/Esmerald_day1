Principles
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[18]

It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
It must be robust and secure.
It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
It must execute with high performance.
It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

Versions

As of September 2021, Java 8, 11 and 17 are
 supported as Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.[39]

Oracle released the last zero-cost public update
for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use,
although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates
for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer
zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 18 and 8, 11 and 17 that are still
receiving security and other upgrades.
